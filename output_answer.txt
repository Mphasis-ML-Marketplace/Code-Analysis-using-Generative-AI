The scripts present are interconnected and work together to form a travel booking system.
The "All_Airports.json" script is responsible for reading airport data from a CSV file, maintaining information about the airports, their countries, currencies, and obtaining the distance between two airports.
The "TravelAgent.json" script is where these separate parts come together. It creates trips using the data obtained from the "All_Airports.json" and "AirLines.json" scripts. It can create different types of trips like one-way, two-city one-way, round trips, and multi-city trips. It also has a function to create a trip with flexible routes, which finds the cheapest combination of cities to visit.
